## üèÅ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

You need a web browser to view the website.

### Installation

1.  Clone the repo
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/AhmedAl-Bahrawy/ahmedalbahrawy_website.git
    ```
2.  Open `index.html` in your browser.

## üìä Data Management

The website uses a simple yet powerful data management system based on JSON files. This approach separates the content from the code, making it easy to update the website without touching the HTML or JavaScript.

*   `static/data/website-data.json`: This file contains all the text content of the website, including the site info, profile, stats, skills, projects, reviews, services, contact, footer, and navigation.
*   `static/data/projects.json`: This file contains the image gallery information for the projects.

The `static/js/website-data.js` file contains a `WebsiteDataManager` class that loads the data from the JSON files and provides methods to access and render the data.

For more details, please refer to the `README-Data-Management.md` file.
